|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|

The volunteer team has been reallocated efficiently with minimal impact on their original duties; now serving as registration support staff at the new location instead of venue-specific roles, ensuring all essential functions proceed smoothly while keeping our commitments to festival guests intact|
